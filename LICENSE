NOVAscore v0.2 — Demo Edition

This repository contains a conceptual and educational demonstration model 
("NOVAscore Demo") developed and authored by David Olivares (2026).

This version is provided exclusively for educational, illustrative, and
portfolio purposes. It is not a production-grade risk engine, not a
regulatory capital model, and not intended for commercial deployment
without further validation, governance, regulatory review, and model risk
controls.

The implementation presented here represents a simplified simulation
framework designed to demonstrate macro-stress credit risk dynamics,
capital allocation logic, and risk-based pricing concepts.
